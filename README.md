## About

I have done a similiar [project](https://github.com/itspedruu/lines-of-code) using Javascript but I have recently learned Haskell and I thought I could do a simple remake of the project in just a few lines of code much smaller than what I did with the other project and much more readable! That's the beauty of Haskell.

## Setup

You will need [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) then simply execute on the project folder:

```
cabal build
```
